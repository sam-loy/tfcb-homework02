# Homework 2: Unix shell

This homework will assess your ability to run commands in the shell and make a simple script.

Replace the lines specified in _italics_ with your answers and save as a text file.


## Problem 0

**60 points**

Complete the interactive tutorial.

I think the tutorial was very helpful overall but simple things like how to format or place my '..'s and '/'s in my commands to get the output I want just takes getting used to. The biggest point of frustration for me was getting used to the commands and what flags or arguments worked with what. There is just a lot to learn but that is fine.

## Problem 1

**20 points**

**Write a script that outputs some user and location data and moves that output to a newly created directory**

Make a single script that prints out a file called question01.txt. 

This file should contain the following text:

  My username is (your username, but the script needs to work for anyone, not just you)

  My home directory is (your home directory, but the script needs to work for anyone, not just you)

  The contents of the tfcb_2023/lectures/lecture04/ directory are

  (prints the contents of that directory)

This script should also create a directory called homework02, and move question01.txt into the homework02 directory.

An example output answer should be:

My username is campbellm <br>
My home directory is /Users/melody <br>
The contents of the tfcb_2023/lectures/lecture04/ directory are<br>
01-first-steps.md<br>
02-directories<br>
03-redirection<br>
04-vim<br>
05-history<br>
06-scripting<br>
07-more-interactive-shell<br>
README.md<br>
quickref.md<br>
sequence.gb<br>
slides<br>
vader.txt<br>

#Homework02 Script by Sam Loy	
echo My user name is $USER > question01.txt
echo My home directory is $home >> question01.txt
echo The contents of the tfcb_2023/lectures/lecture04 directory are >> question01.txt
ls -1 lectures/lecture04 >> question01.txt #alter the directory accordingly if not working in the TFCB dev container
mkdir homework02
mv question01.txt homework02

## Problem 2

**20 points**

**Write a script that uses a loop to output files with specific names**


Make a single script that does the following:

Makes a new directory in homework02 called question02

In that directory, your script should make 25 new files called
file###.txt

the ### should be the numbers from a list you can find here:

tfcb_2023/homeworks/homework02/list.txt

You can make the contents of those files whatever you want (hint: slide 9... )

#Script for making 25 files named after	numbers in 'list.txt' by Sam Loy
#Make sure you are starting in the tfcb_2023/homeworks/homework02 directory
mkdir question02
cd question02
for k in `cat ../list.txt`; do echo text_$k.txt > file$k.txt; done
